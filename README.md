# CV Beautify

> **🔗 Live demo:** [https://cv-builder-ai--devitkachenko.replit.app/](https://cv-builder-ai--devitkachenko.replit.app/)

An AI-powered web app that generates polished, professional resumes from any uploaded document in seconds. Simply upload your existing CV (PDF, DOCX, or plain text), pick a template — and the AI rewrites, structures, and formats your content into a pixel-perfect resume, ready to download as a PDF.

---

## ✨ Features

- **AI Content Extraction** — Upload a DOCX. file. The AI reads your raw content, understands it as a resume, and adapts it to the selected template.
- **10 Professional Templates** — Carefully crafted HTML/CSS templates ranging from minimalist to two-column designs, with full color backgrounds.
- **Smart PDF Generation** — Custom PDF engine that handles multi-page layouts, consistent margins, background fills, and never splits a content block mid-element.
- **Multi-language UI** — Interface available in English and Ukrainian (i18n via i18next).
- **Resume Management** — Save, view, and re-download all previously generated resumes from your dashboard.
- **Responsive Design** — Works on desktop and mobile, including collapsible navigation for smaller screens.

## 🔄 How It Works

```
User uploads CV file
        ↓
Server extracts text (DOCX → mammoth, PDF → text extraction)
        ↓
AI validates it's actually a CV (cv-validator.ts)
        ↓
User picks a template in the modal
        ↓
Server calls OpenAI GPT-4o to rewrite & inject content into the HTML template
        ↓
Generated HTML is saved to the database (resumes table)
        ↓
CvViewPage fetches the HTML and renders it in an iframe
        ↓
User clicks "Download PDF" → pdf-generator.ts runs the custom pagination logic
        ↓
html2pdf.js renders the final PDF with correct page breaks and backgrounds
```
